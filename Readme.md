# Virtual Queue Management System (VQMS)

## üöÄ Project Title: Virtual Queue Management System (VQMS)

### üìå Problem Statement
Waiting in long queues is a frustrating and time-consuming experience. Businesses and organizations need an efficient queue management system to reduce waiting times and enhance customer experience. The Virtual Queue Management System (VQMS) aims to streamline the queueing process by allowing users to join a queue virtually and get real-time updates on their position and estimated wait time.

## üõ† Solution Overview
The VQMS is a web-based application that enables users to join a virtual queue, track their position, and receive notifications when their turn is approaching. It leverages:
- **Frontend:** React.js (for an interactive UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL (for storing queue data)
- **Email Notifications:** Nodemailer (for notifying users when their turn is near)
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSockets (for dynamic queue position updates)
